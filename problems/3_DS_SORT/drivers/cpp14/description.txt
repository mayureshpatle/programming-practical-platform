Complete the following Solution class. it should contain function sort(int *, int), in which the first argument is an array, and the second argument is the length of the array.

For more clarity,

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:

//your solution starts here

//this function is mandatory, you can change the names of arguments.
//but the function signature void sort(int * , int ) should not be altered
void sort(int * arr, int size)
{
	//function definition
}

/*
SOME TIPS:
you can write other functions here if required
do not take input from stdin or print anything on stdout or stderr
you cannot include any header file
*/

//your solution ends here
};
```
