You just have to write the contents of function int gcd(int a, int b).

Your function should return the greatest common divisor of **a** and **b**. Do not print anything on the output.
```c 
int gcd(int a, int b)
{ 
	//you have to write this part only
	//no need to write the function name & braces  
} 
```
